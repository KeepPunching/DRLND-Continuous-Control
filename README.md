# DRLND - Project 2: Continuous Control - REACHER Environment

### Introduction

In this environment, a double-jointed arm can move to target locations. A reward of +0.1 is provided for each step that the agent's hand is in the goal location. Thus, the goal of your agent is to maintain its position at the target location for as many time steps as possible.

The observation space consists of 33 variables corresponding to position, rotation, velocity, and angular velocities of the arm. Each action is a vector with four numbers, corresponding to torque applicable to two joints. Every entry in the action vector should be a number between -1 and 1.

### Solving the Environment

#### Option 1: Solve the First Version

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment,  your agent must get an average score of +30 over 100 consecutive episodes.

#### Option 2: Solve the Second Version

The barrier for solving the second version of the environment is slightly different, to take into account the presence of many agents.  In particular, your agents must get an average score of +30 (over 100 consecutive episodes, and over all agents).  Specifically,
- After each episode, add up the rewards that each agent received (without discounting), to get a score for each agent.  This yields 20 (potentially different) scores.  Take the average of these 20 scores. 
- This yields an **average score** for each episode (where the average is over all 20 agents).

The environment is considered solved, when the average (over 100 episodes) of those average scores is at least +30.

1) The code for agent is provided in ddpg_agent.py. 


2) The code for neural used for learning actor-critic network is provided in model.py. 


3) The code used for loading the environment and training the agent is embedded in python notebook Continuous_Control.ipynb. 


4) Trained network parameters are saved in checkpoint_actor.pth

 and checkpoint_critic.pth



Steps to follow for setting up envirnonment:



1) Set up Python Environment: Please follow the instructions in the [DRLND GitHub repository] (https://github.com/udacity/deep-reinforcement-learning#dependencies) to set up your Python environment. 




2) Load Jupyter Notebook Continous_Control.ipynb and run code cells inside to see results.
